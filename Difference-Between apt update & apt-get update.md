# Difference Between `apt update` and `apt-get update`

When managing packages in a Debian-based Linux system like Ubuntu, you might come across two similar commands: `apt update` and `apt-get update`. Let's explore the differences between these two commands, especially for beginners in cybersecurity.

## Overview
- **`apt`** and **`apt-get`** are tools used to interact with the package management system in Debian-based Linux distributions.
- **`apt update`** and **`apt-get update`** are used to update the package list, but they have some differences in terms of usability and intended audience.

### Key Differences

| Feature                  | `apt update`                      | `apt-get update`                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **User Experience**      | More user-friendly and easy to use | Traditional, more complex, and detailed |
| **Output**               | Provides progress bar and better formatting | Plain text output, without progress bar |
| **Recommended For**      | General users and beginners       | Advanced users and scripts       |
| **Default Tool**         | Introduced to replace `apt-get` for everyday use | Older tool for package management |
| **Commands Available**   | Shorter and more intuitive        | More commands, but more complex  |

### Detailed Points

1. **Command Introduction**
   - **`apt`** is a newer command introduced as a more user-friendly tool to replace some of the commonly used functions of `apt-get`.
   - **`apt-get`** has been around for a long time and is more suitable for scripting and automation tasks.

2. **User Experience**
   - **`apt update`** has a cleaner output that includes a progress bar, making it easier to understand what's happening during the update process.
   - **`apt-get update`** provides a more raw output, which can be beneficial for debugging or advanced users who want to see detailed information.

3. **Which One Should You Use?**
   - For beginners in cybersecurity, it's recommended to use **`apt update`** as it is more intuitive and provides clearer feedback.
   - Advanced users, or those who need to automate processes, may still prefer **`apt-get update`** due to its more consistent behavior in scripts.

### Summary
- Both **`apt update`** and **`apt-get update`** update the package lists from the repositories, so the system knows about the latest versions of the software available.
- Use **`apt update`** for a simplified, user-friendly experience.
- Use **`apt-get update`** for scripting or when more control is needed.

> Remember: When managing packages, `apt` is more suited for beginners, while `apt-get` is for more advanced and automation use cases.
