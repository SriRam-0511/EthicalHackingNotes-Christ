Kali Linux Setup:
A quick reference for downloading and installing Kali Linux for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

1. Downloading Kali Linux from Official Download Page
Go to the official Kali Linux download page or site:
  => https://www.kali.org/get-kali/

  a. For windows users:
        Install Required Software:
                => VirtualBox
                => VMware Workstation Player (Optional)

        Import Kali into VirtualBox: 
                => Open VirtualBox
                => Go to File -> Import Appliance
                => Select the (.ova) file you downloaded
                => Click Import
                => Start the VM
                [NOTE: Enable virtualization in BIOS if VM is slow or fails to start]
  b. For Mac users:
        => Option A: Using VirtualBox (Intel Macs)
                Steps:
                      => Install VirtualBox for macOS
                      => Download (.ova) from Kali linux official site
                      => Import via File -> Import Appliance

                      => Start VM
                [NOTE: M1 and M2 Macs do not support x86 VMs in VirtualBox. So use UTM for Apple Silicon]

        => Option B: Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
                      => Use UTM
                      => Download ARM image from Kali ARM images
                      => Import (.img.xz) into UTM and configure

2. Choose Your Version

Pick the appropriate image depending on your use case:
  a. "Regular Install" with extension (.iso) used for installation on hardware or virtual machines.
  b. "Live Boot" with file extension (Live ISO)	used to run Kali without installing (with persistence optional).
  c. "Virtual Machine (VM)" with file extension	(.ova) is used as a pre-built for VMware or VirtualBox.
  d. "ARM Devices" with file extension (.img.xz) used for the usage of Raspberry Pi, Pinebook, etc.
